Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

We were given the code to the maze, directions, simulation of a trained agent, and a check for if the agent is able to find the treasure. The code that needed to be completed was the Q-training algorithm to train the pirate agent. The algorithm uses both exploration and exploitation to train the agent and save each episode to teach the agent.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists create solutions for problems using a viariety of computer related methods. They must solve large issues efficiently and keeping ethics and bias in check. They can create algorithms to gather data, interpret and use data to accomplish tasks.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Breaking down the problems into smaller, easier to accomplish tasks. Checking each step to insure hard requirements are focused on first and the implimentation will be ethical.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethics are an important part when working with automated systems that could either gather or analyze data on end users and organizations. To keep bias away from interpreting the information and protect the privacy of end users.
